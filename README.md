# 👋 Hi there, I'm Geistnigma 

🔍 Currently working as a Junior SOC Analyst 🌱, with the goal of moving into the **DFIR field** 

📝 On my Github, I'll be sharing content related to **DFIR, OSINT, Malware Analysis, and CTFs stuff**

I'll start publishing **forensic case studies** (both self-created scenarios and analyses of real-word style cases) to practice and level up my skills. (Coming soon 🚀)

## 🤝 Get in touch 

Don’t be shy! If you’d like to chat about **DFIR, OSINT, Malware, Reverse Engineering, CTFs**, or anything related, feel free to reach out, I will be glad to discuss with you ! 😉
